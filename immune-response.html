  <h2>The Body's Response</h2>
  <p>The spread and infection of marburg virus in the human body is often known to be so disastrous due to the 
    complexity of the effects it has on the immune system. The initial innate human immune response that usually 
    fights off viruses and bacteria, are attacked by the marburg virus' proteins and impair or completely stop the immune response. 
    When these functions are depleted or impaired, immune cell depletion will occur, ultimately resulting in organ damage or 
    complete organ failure.  </p>
