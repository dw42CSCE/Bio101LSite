  <h2>How the Pathogen Causes Disease</h2>
  <p>In early stages of marburg virus, high fever, cluster-like headaches, and severe body aches. 
    These first symptoms highly resemble the average to severe flu case. Once Marburg virus fully spreads and infects the body, 
    more severe symptoms occur. These range from diarrhea, severe nausea, uncontrollable vomiting, extreme bodily temperatures, 
    and more. One of the most notable side effects and symptoms of Marburg virus is a sudden or gradual delirium and dissociation. 
    According to a journal article created by Hans Dieter Klenk in 2007, the first early cases of the virus showed exact, 
    flu-like responses for the first 10-18 days, until bodily functions started shutting down in severe ways that a flu could not cause. 
    (Klenk et Slenckza 2007).
