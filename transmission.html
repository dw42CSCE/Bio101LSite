  <h2>How the Pathogen Causes Disease</h2>
  <p>In the majority of cases, MBV is spread to humans via direct contact with an infected species, typically bats (Brauburger et al., 2012).
     Human to human transmission is achieved through contact with bodily fluids of an infected human. 
     Infected humans remain contagious past death, leading to infections via the handling of corpses.
    MBV is most common in Sub Saharan Africa, however even here it is fairly rare,
     "To date there have been in total 452 cases and 368 documented deaths due to MVD" (Brauburger et al., 2012). 
    However, it is likely that these numbers are significantly underreported, as the disease is often misdiagnosed as other hemorrhagic fevers.</p>
