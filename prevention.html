  <h2>How to Stop The Disease</h2>
  <p>There are vaccines being produced yet none are approved yet. So far, most of these vaccines are in phase 1 clinical trials, but one that is planned for 2nd and 3rd clinical trials is MVA-BN-Filo. Some other vaccines that are being tested are a DNA vaccine, cAd3, and rVSV vaccine, but these have yet to get past phase 1 clinical trials. 
    <br/><br/>
    DNA- based vaccines are being explored because of the safety and ability to stimulate hormonal responses, but are usually not enough to fully control the Marburg virus. So, scientists are planning to use DNA-based vaccines in conjunction with other vaccines to increase effectiveness.
    <br/><br/>
    Recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Vaccine (rVSV) have shown a lot of promise, showing to be very effective against filoviruses, including Marburg. However, there have been no phase 1 trials for Marburg specifically yet.
    Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) focuses on administering vaccines after the virus is encountered, In order to prevent viral replication. Tests showed this to be effective if given around 30 minutes after exposure to Marburg.
