  <h2>How the Pathogen Causes Disease</h2>
  <p>There are no licensed treatments yet. However, there are some therapies that have been shown to be effective, with some listed below:<br/><br/>
    1. Small Interfering RNA: NP-718-LNP<br/>
    Uses lipid nanoparticles to deliver siRNA to target the Marburg virus nucleoprotein gene. 
    Studies show early treatment is effective with this method.<br/><br/>
    2. Nucleoside Analog Inhibitor: BCX4430 (Galidesivir)<br/>
    Synthetic nucleoside analog designed to target and inhibit the viral RNA polymerase. Treatment between 1-48 hours has shown good results.<br/><br/>
    3. Synthetic Nucleoside Analog: Favipiravir (T-705)<br/>
    Synthetic guanidine nucleoside analog with broad antiviral properties. Not quite as effective depending on how it was administered.
